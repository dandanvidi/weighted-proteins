================================================================

  1. Diseases -> move to become last category
  2. Organismal Systems -> move to become second but last category
  3. Metabolism -> move to become third but last category
  4. Membrane transport -> move to be first subcategory in "Metabolism"
  5. Rename Category "Enzymes" -> "Other enzymes"
  6. Rename Category "Chromosome" -> "Chromosome related"
  7. Insert new category "Cell wall" as last subcategory in "Cell growth and death"
  8. Rename Categor "Ubiquitin system" -> "Ubiquitin labeling"
  9. Rename Category "DNA replication" -> "DNA replication complex"
 10. Rename Category "DNA replication proteins" -> "DNA replication control"
 11. Rename Category 	GTP-binding proteins -> GTP-binding signaling proteins
 12. Remove category titles "MAPK signaling pathway - fly" and "MAPK signaling pathway - yeast"
    -> all KO entries become "MAPK signaling pathway"
 13. Rename Subcategory "Enzyme families" -> "Other enzymes"
 14. Rename Category "Meiosis yeast" -> "Meiosis"
 15. Remove category title "Cell cycle - yeast", all elements become elements of "Cell cycle"
 16. Make new Category "Cytoskeleton" before "Cell motility", move subcategories "Regulation of actin cytoskeleton" and  "Cytoskeleton  proteins" there
 17. Rename "Replication and repair" to "DNA maintenance"
 18. Rename "Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis" to "tRNA loading"
 19. Rename Category "Further enzymes" -> "Other enzymes"
 20. New subcategory "Cytokinesis" directly before "meiosis" 
 21. Move entire subcategory "Peptidases" from "Further enzymes" to "Folding, Sorting and Degradation" (behind "proteasome")
 22. Rename "Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)" to "Citrate cycle"
 23. Rename "Transport and Catabolism" to "Vesicular transport"
 24. Add branch "Hemoglobin" -> "Hemoglobin" -> K13823 under "Cellular processes"
 
 Changes in version 1.2
  1. Rename Category "Carbohydrate metabolism" -> "Central Carbon Metabolism"
  2. Rename Category "Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis" -> "Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis"
  3. Rename Category "Citrate cycle" -> "TCA cycle and anaplerotic enzymes"
  4. Move all KO entries in Category "glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism"
     into "TCA cycle and anaplerotic enzymes"
  5. Remove all occurances of the following KO entires and put them only once in "TCA cycle and anaplerotic enzymes"
     K01638 (aceB), K01595 (ppc), K00027 (maeA), K00029 (maeB)
